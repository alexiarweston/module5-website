            <h2>Feeding Your Cat</h2>
            <p>
                Cats require a balanced diet that includes protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Consult with your vet to
                determine the best food for your cat's age and health needs.

            <h2>Grooming</h2>
            <p>
                Regular grooming helps keep your cat's coat healthy and reduces shedding. Brush your cat at least once a
                week, and more frequently for long-haired breeds.

                Understanding your cat's behavior is key to a happy relationship. Provide toys, scratching posts, and
                regular playtime to keep them engaged.
